## Overview

These mini projects cover various domains like customer churn prediction, fake news detection, heart disease prediction, and others, applying different machine learning and deep learning techniques. Each project uses R for data manipulation, exploratory data analysis, and visualization, while Python handles the machine learning, deep learning, and deployment aspects. The integration of both languages demonstrates a hybrid approach to solving problems efficiently.
